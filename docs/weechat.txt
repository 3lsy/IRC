https://modern.ircdocs.horse/#join-message

If a client’s JOIN command to the server is successful, the server MUST send, in this order:

    A JOIN message with the client as the message <source> and the channel they have joined as the first parameter of the message.
    The channel’s topic (with RPL_TOPIC (332) and optionally RPL_TOPICWHOTIME (333)), and no message if the channel does not have a topic.
    A list of users currently joined to the channel (with one or more RPL_NAMREPLY (353) numerics followed by a single RPL_ENDOFNAMES (366) numeric). These RPL_NAMREPLY messages sent by the server MUST include the requesting client that has just joined the channel.
